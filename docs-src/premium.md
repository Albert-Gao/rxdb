# RxDB Premium

To make RxDB a sustainable Project, some plugins are not part of the RxDB open source project. Instead they are part of the `rxdb-premium` package.


## Premium plugins

- [RxStorage IndexedDB](./rx-storage-indexeddb.md) a really fast [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) implementation based on **IndexedDB**. Made to be used in browsers.
- [RxStorage SQLite](./rx-storage-sqlite.md) a really fast [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) implementation based on **SQLite**. Made to be used on **Node.js**, **Electron**, **React Native**, **Cordova** or **Capacitor**.
- [RxStorage Sharding](./rx-storage-sharding.md) a wrapper around any other [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) that improves performance by applying the sharding technique.
- **migrateRxDBV11ToV12** A plugins that migrates data from any RxDB v11 storage to a new RxDB v12 database. Use this when you upgrade from RxDB 11->12 and you have to keep your database state.
